## About The Project

The TPG Playground is an interactive web interface designed for experimenting with Tangled Program Graphs (TPG) in various MuJoCo environments. This platform allows users to evolve policies, visualize the learning process, and gain insights into the behavior of TPG agents. It provides a user-friendly environment for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore the capabilities of TPG in reinforcement learning tasks.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Environment Selection:** Choose from a variety of MuJoCo environments to train and test TPG agents.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Observe the agent's behavior in the selected environment during the evolution process.
- **Policy Evolution:** Evolve policies using the TPG algorithm directly within the web interface.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Track and visualize training experiments, including generation number, fitness scores, and other relevant metrics.
- **WebRTC Integration:** Utilizes WebRTC for real-time video streaming of the agent's visualization.
- **WebSocket Communication:** Implements WebSocket for signaling and communication between the client and server.
- **Responsive Design:** Provides a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the TPG Playground, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >= 18)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tpgengine/playground.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Start the backend signaling server - ensure that you have the [tpg]{https://github.com/TPGEngine/tpg.git} repo fully setup with `uv` installed

   ```sh
   git checkout feat/tpg-web
   cd src/src/api
   uv sync
   uv run fastapi dev
   ```

This will start the application in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the TPG Playground.
